# LogicTask

**Write a program that creates  a PHP script that is executed form the command line. The script should:** <br />
<br />
• Output the numbers from 1 to 100  <br />
• Where the number is divisible by three (3) output the word “foo”  <br />
• Where the number is divisible by five (5) output the word “bar”  <br />
• Where the number is divisible by three (3) and (5) output the word “foobar”  <br />
• Only be a single PHP file  <br />

**Example:**  <br />

1, 2, foo, 4, bar, foo, 7, 8, foo, bar, 11, foo, 13, 14, foobar ...  <br />

**More details:**  <br />

• Number 3 is divisible by 3, so we print foo  <br />
• Number 5 is divisible by 5, so we print bar  <br />
• Number 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5 so we print fobar  <br />
